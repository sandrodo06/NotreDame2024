            <p>In a world where hours hunched over screens have become the norm, bad posture has become a serious issue. It doesn’t only affect your back and neck—poor posture is linked to headaches, fatigue, and even spinal damage. Here’s where Notredame comes in, promising to change the way we sit, stand, and move.</p>

            <p>Backed by real science, Notredame has shown a 17% improvement in spinal alignment after just six weeks of use. Even better, 80% of users reported less neck and back discomfort, making it a game-changer for desk-bound professionals.</p>

            <p>Experts in physical therapy praise the app’s intuitive feedback system, which mimics the benefits once available only through professional sessions. Dr. Lucy Harrington, a physical therapist with 15 years of experience, states, "The app’s constant reminders and real-time posture corrections not only engage users but also promote long-lasting benefits."</p>
